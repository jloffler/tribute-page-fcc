Chris Hadfield is a famous retired Canadian astronaut. Most notable for using social media while onboard the International Space Station (ISS), leading to increased public interest in outer-space exploration.

In 1969, young 9 year old Chris, watched on television as, Niel Armstrong took "one giant leap for mankind", and first stepped on to the surface of the moon. Chris attributes this moment to the solidification of his life goal to go to space. From then on when faced with any decision, whichever "attitude" (the orientation a space-ship is pointing) was facing the stars, is the direction he would choose to go.

Even though there were no Canadian astronauts when he was a child, he decided to follow the path most American astronauts take to get to space, in hopes that that might one day change. Thus he learned to fly with the Royal Canadian Air Cadets as a teenager. Studied hard to get an engineering degree. Became a Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) fighter, and test pilot. Finally in 1992 Chris was selected to become a Canadian Space Agency (CSA) astronaut.

Over his CSA career Chris has completed several prominent missions, including being the first ever Canadian to walk in space. On his first space shuttle mission, he became the only Canadian to board the Russian space station Mir. On STS-100 he helped setup the Canadarm2.

In 2013 Chris became the onboard commander of the ISS. He became well known for posting: beautiful images of space and the Earth, videos showcasing science and life in micro-gravity, and even songs recorded in space, to social media. His posts spread like wild-fire back on terra-firma, especially his cover of the song "Space Oddity" by David Bowie. He was even the (remote) guest of several TV news, and talk shows while orbiting the Earth at 27600 km/h.

Chris Retired from the space-faring life once safely back on the ground after ISS Expedition 35.
