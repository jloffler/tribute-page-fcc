# Astronaut Chris Hadfield Tribute Webpage

## Live site on GitHub Pages

 - project completion date
 
### Project: Tribute Page
freeCodeCamp - https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-tribute-page

Build a website using HTML and CSS that is functionally similar to https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/zNqgVx

## Goals
 - Use semantic and accesible HTML
 - Make it responsive
 - Make a splash image that takes up the whole viewport
 - Embed a youtube video
 - Make it actually look good and compelling to read

## Things I learned
 - width: 100vw; does not act like I think it should. It tends to add a
   scroll bar at the bottom the the page and make content flow under the
   right side scroll bar. Use % units.
 - Scroll bars and full width/height... so annoying.
   - Position: fixed and absolute seem to deal with vertical scroll bars
     differently than relative
 - Inline elements, such as images, have space below (that is not
   padding or margin) for text descenders (lower case "g" goes below other letters).
