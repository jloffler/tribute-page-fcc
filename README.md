## Project: Tribute Page
freeCodeCamp - https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-tribute-page

## Objective
Build a website using HTML and CSS that is functionally similar to https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/zNqgVx

## Things I learned
 - width: 100vw; does not act like I think it should. It tends to add a
   scroll bar at the bottom the the page and make content flow under the
   right side scroll bar. Use % units.
 - Scroll bars and full width/height... so annoying.
   - Position: fixed and absolute seem to deal with vertical scroll bars
     differently than relative

## Goals
 - Use semantic and accesible HTML
 - Make it responsive
 - Use an organized code structure
