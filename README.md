### Project: Tribute Page
freeCodeCamp - https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-tribute-page

Build a website using HTML and CSS that is functionally similar to https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/zNqgVx

## Goals
 - Use semantic and accesible HTML
 - Make it responsive
 - Make a Hero image that takes up the whole viewport on load
 - Make it actually look good and compelling to read

## Things I learned
 - Responsive images:
   - Different file-size of same image to save on bandwidth.
   - Art Direction: Different images (even just cropping) for different sized screens.
 - Object-fit and object position to let css crop images.
 - Limiting the width of paragraphs to create ease of readability
 - Leaving image alt text empty (alt="") if an image is just for art
 - width: 100vw; does not act like I think it should. It tends to add a
   scroll bar at the bottom the the page and make content flow under the
   right side scroll bar. Use % units.
 - Scroll bars and full width/height... so annoying.
   - Position: fixed and absolute seem to deal with vertical scroll bars
     differently than relative
 - Inline elements, such as images, have space below (that is not
   padding or margin) for text descenders (lower case "g" goes below other letters).
